# School Dashboard — Next.js + TypeScript + Prisma

A school administration dashboard template built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and Prisma. This workspace contains the UI, Prisma schema, sample migrations and a seed script for local development.

## Highlights

- Next.js app-router layout with sections for admin, teacher, student and parent
- Tailwind CSS utility-first styling
- Prisma ORM with schema and migrations in `prisma/`
- Reusable components: tables, charts, calendar and forms in `components/`

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (recommended)
- npm (or yarn / pnpm)
- A supported database for Prisma (SQLite is easiest for local development)

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd nextjs/school_dashboard
npm install
```

2. Create or update `.env`

At minimum set a `DATABASE_URL`. Example for SQLite (local dev):

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

3. Run Prisma migrations and seed (if using the included seed script)

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma db seed
```

4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

Notes:

- Use `pnpm` or `yarn` if you prefer; replace `npm` commands accordingly.
- If `prisma` CLI commands fail, confirm `DATABASE_URL` and that `prisma` is installed.

## Project layout (important files)

- `app/` — app router pages and layouts; dashboard sections under `app/(dashboard)/`
- `components/` — UI primitives and feature components (Table, Chart, Forms)
- `lib/prisma.ts` — Prisma client
- `prisma/` — `schema.prisma`, migrations and `seed.ts`
- `public/` — static assets (icons, images)
- `data.ts` — demo/local data helpers

## Prisma & database

- Migrations live in `prisma/migrations` — review before applying to production databases.
- The included seed script (if present) populates demo data used by the UI.

## Build & production

Build and start:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Deployment notes:

- This project is suitable for Vercel. Set environment variables (DATABASE_URL, any third-party keys) on your hosting provider.
- For production databases, prefer a managed DB and a safe migration strategy.

## Contributing

- Open issues for feature requests or bugs. Submit PRs for fixes. For larger changes, open an issue first.

## Possible next edits

- I can add a `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.env.example`, or update `package.json` scripts with exact commands. Tell me which you'd like.

Generated by a repository helper. If you'd like, I can tailor the README with exact script contents from the project's `package.json` or add step-by-step Prisma seed details.
